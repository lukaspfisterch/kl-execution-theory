# Whitepaper Materials

This directory contains working materials for a future whitepaper  
on KL Execution Theory.

The intent is to separate long form narrative and publication ready  
content from the core axioms and formal definitions in the root  
and `axioms/` and `formal/` directories.

The whitepaper will integrate:

- the axioms of KL Execution Theory  
- the execution semantics and state machine model  
- the type system  
- mappings to concrete domains and implementations  
- motivation and design principles

Current files:

- `outline.md`  
  High level structure of the planned whitepaper.  
  Sections, headings and flow of argument.

- `abstract.md`  
  Draft abstract describing the problem, proposal and contribution.

- `motivation.md`  
  Expanded explanation of why the theory is needed and which gaps it addresses.

- `external_review.md`  
  Independent evaluation from multiple perspectives: peer review, executive summary,  
  and formal appendix. Provides external validation and assessment of the theory's  
  strengths, challenges, and practical relevance.

As the theory and implementations mature, this directory may gain:

- a full draft manuscript  
- figures and diagrams prepared for publication  
- references and related work summaries  
- appendix material for formal proofs or extended examples

The whitepaper materials are not a specification.  
They are a curated narrative intended for a broader technical audience,  
built on top of the formal content defined in the rest of the repository.
