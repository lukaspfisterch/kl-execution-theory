# Abstract

Modern computational, financial and biological systems operate under  
increasing complexity and opacity. They rely on execution models that  
are often ad-hoc, non-deterministic and difficult to audit.  
This makes reproducibility, governance and policy alignment  
hard to guarantee in practice.

KL Execution Theory proposes a minimal, domain-neutral framework  
for deterministic execution based on five axioms:  
atomic state transitions (Δ), ordered behaviour (V),  
logical time (t), derived governance (G) and derived boundaries (L).  
Together, these axioms define a simple but complete structure for  
representing execution, reasoning about it and evaluating it.

The theory separates execution from evaluation:  
execution builds behaviour, while governance and boundaries  
classify and characterise it. This separation enables  
replayability, auditability and policy-first design  
without constraining domain semantics.

KL Execution Theory can be mapped to real systems such as  
deterministic computation engines, financial order books,  
biological process simulations and AI governance pipelines.  
Across these domains, it provides a unified semantic substrate  
that supports deterministic replay, transparent audit trails,  
constraint analysis and formal governance models.

The result is a minimal but expressive foundation  
for building systems that must be both powerful and accountable.  
It serves as a conceptual backbone for implementations such as  
KL Kernel Logic and the Deterministic Boundary Layer,  
and as a starting point for future infrastructures  
requiring trust, reproducibility and structured governance.
